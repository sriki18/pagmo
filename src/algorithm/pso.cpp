/**
 *  @brief Arranges particles in a random graph having a parameterized maximum outdegree; the graph changes adaptively over time
 *  
 *	''At the very beginning, and after each unsuccessful iteration (no
 *	improvement of the best known fitness value), the graph of the information
 *	links is modified: each particle informs at random K particles (the same
 *	particle may be chosen several times), and informs itself. The parameter K
 *	is usually set to 3. It means that each particle informs at less one
 *	particle (itself), and at most K+1 particles (including itself). It also
 *	means that each particle can be informed by any number of particles between
 *	1 and S. However, the distribution of the possible number of "informants"
 *	is not uniform. On average, a particle is often informed by about K others,
 *	but it may be informed by a much larger number of particles with a small
 *	probability'' \n
